        p
          | Our mission is to bridge the gap between the travellers and the local
          | travel agents. We work to provide institutions with recreational as
          | well as educational trips. Our travel experts are trained to help the
          | institutions organize a trip by helping them in getting qoutes from
          | different travel agents for the same trip.
